Simple backbone.js application, running on couchdb

This project uses the javascript couchapp, not the python one.

Mostly this project was written to help me get a handle on both backbone and using couchdb in a somewhat realworld way. You are welcome to use it as an teaching/learning tool, but it is very "yucky" from a project orginization standpoint. There are no unit tests, the code isn't very clean, and I'm sure there are a lot of places where it can be refactored.
