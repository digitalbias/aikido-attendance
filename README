Simple backbone.js application, running on couchdb

To run the node.js server:
server.js
or
forever start server.js

To publish to couchdb,

couchapp push attendance.js http://localhost:5984/aikido

There are still issues with the couchdb deployment. For example, the /students url does not resolve yet within couchdb to the correct url
