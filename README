Simple backbone.js application, running on couchdb

This project uses the node.js couchapp, not the python one.

Mostly this project was written to help me get a handle on both backbone and using couchdb in a somewhat realworld way. 
You are welcome to use it as an teaching/learning tool, but it is very "yucky" from a project orginization standpoint. 
There are no unit tests, the code isn't very clean, and I'm sure there are a lot of places where it can be refactored.

To publish the app, assuming you're pushing to the aikido database on your local machine, you would type the following from the command prompt:
couchapp push attendance.js http://localhost:5984/aikido
